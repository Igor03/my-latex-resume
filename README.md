# My Latex Resume
This is just a repository to hold an adptation of an existing overleaf resume template. In it, I added some features like hyperlinks to work experiences section and new sections, which I judged important.

## Document Structure

### Important
Feel free to add/remove any sections you want. This template makes it very easy to perform those operations.

## Downloading and editing
To use this template, simply clone this repository, import the .tex and .cls document to a Tex editor and start making your changes.
I personally use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/),  which is an online tex platform that allows you to do a whole bunch of things regarding .tex documents.
Overleaf also has the [Overleaf Templates Galery](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv/page/1), where you can find a big number of different templates.
